# UBCLibrarySeatFinder-UXProject
This is a project I worked with a team of 5 members in CPSC 444 (HCI Design) course. We aimed to tackle the issue that students face of not being able to find seats in the library, we evaluated the problem using student surveys and created a medium fidelity prototype of an app that could help them tackle this issue using a crowdsourced seat availability application
